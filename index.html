            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width="400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different
                beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as
                he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to
                admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his
                energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
                ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h2>Raven Huskey</h2>

            <p>
                Raven the Husky is a furry force of nature, and mischief is her middle name. With a sleek, obsidian coat
                that glistens like a moonlit night, she's a canine enigma wrapped in fur. Her striking blue eyes seem to
                hold the secrets of the cosmos, and when she gazes at you, it's as though she's pondering the mysteries
                of the universe.</p>
            <P>But don't be fooled by her stoic appearance; Raven is a certified goofball. She'll gleefully "talk" to
                you in her husky howl language, and her zoomies in the backyard are the stuff of legend. When she's not
                channeling her inner wolf, Raven loves cuddling up for Netflix marathons, where she insists on occupying
                most of the couch. With Raven around, life is an adventure filled with laughter, love, and a whole lot
                of fur.</P>
